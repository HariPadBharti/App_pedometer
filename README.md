# pedometer

The theme concept behind this app is the inbuilt features of smartphones that have accelerometer embedded inside to calculate and respond the changes in orientation, movement, direction and positions. Accelerometer not only helps any android phone to perceive changes in its position but also measures the relative movements. Whether it’s a lift or unidirectional motion, accelerometer can still detect changes and can help to frame database that can be further used to develop new device based applications.
Pedometer is one such application of accelerometer feature of android device that enables the developer to develop such device based application and can server in more appropriate and accurate manner to save extra device purchase cost and give android users more benefits to switch to smartphones and reduce extra costs and efforts to get separate devices.
Apart from accelerometer, multiple sensors in smartphones including android devices can easily be used to coin out and introduce many devices like compass, light detector, face recognizer etc. which can further broaden the usability of android devices and hence alternatively smartphones.

 Step counter
 Speed detector
 Calorie burned
